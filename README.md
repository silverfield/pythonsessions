# Fero's Python Sessions
Code for the python sessions I led at AIMS institute in Ghana

## About the course 
The code in this repositary along with the guidelines on Python sessions [home page](https://sites.google.com/site/ferospythonsessions/home) can serve as a material for basic-level programming course in Python. Python sessions were held once or twice a week, each time concentrating on some programming concept, algorithm or computer science theory. 

Since introductory programming courses can often get boring, these sessions focus on interesting examples or a bigger final goal. Thus, rather then going systematically through the details of the language syntax and structure, these are learned along the way to build the final script, e.g. a graph plotting application, or matrix-multiplicator.

Each session was about 60-90min long, and usually:
* some **theory** was explained first. [The site](https://sites.google.com/site/ferospythonsessions/home) contains the guidelines and some explanation to each session (up to session 11)
* some **code** was worked on together. This code (along with supporting files, if any) is always in the respective sXY_name_of_session folder. The code the teacher should work towards is in the **solutions** sub-folders of each session's folder
* finally, the students were given optional **exercises**, with task descriptions on the mentioned [site](https://sites.google.com/site/ferospythonsessions/home). Solutions for the exercises are in the exercises subfolders of each session's folder.

## About my stay at AIMS
AIMS is shortcut for African Institute for Mathematical Science. It has several branches accross Africa, and keeps expanding. It is a unique one year MSc programme for bright African students, founded by Neil Turok in his [wish to find the next Einstein in Africa](http://www.ted.com/talks/neil_turok_makes_his_ted_prize_wish?language=en). I spent four months as a tutor at [AIMS in Ghana](https://www.aims.edu.gh/), an amazing experience I will never forget. Hired mostly to help out with programming, I went on to create and carry these Python sessions.
